# NeuralNetwork
Fully Connected Neural Network implementation using tensorflow.

If you will be using without docker then, you will also need to install tensorflow-gpu>=1.5.0

The idea is to make it easy to construct, train and save a
 neural network with several lines of code. 
The code is written in such a way that the neural network 
object is similar to sklearn's other ML models. To have a better
intuition on how to use the neural networks feel free to look into
test_autoencoder and test_classificator jupyter notebooks.
