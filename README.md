# NeuralNetwork
Fully Connected Neural Network implementation using tensorflow 1.5.

A simple interface to train, test and save fully connected networks.
For better intuition on how to use the neural networks have a look into
test_autoencoder and test_classificator jupyter notebooks.

To install needed libraries just run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
